Project bank
Introduction
The "Project bank" project aims to analyze data from bank customers to understand which customer segments responded positively to previous marketing campaigns. By identifying these segments, the goal is to create more targeted marketing campaigns in the future. The intended audience for this project is the marketing team of the bank.

Data Description
The project analyzes data containing demographic information such as education level, marital status, and age, along with whether or not clients purchased the product term deposit.

Analysis Techniques
The initial data preprocessing involved splitting the column names and corresponding values to create a data frame. Null values and duplicates were checked for and subsequently dropped. Visualizations were created for age, education level, and marital status to compare them to the purchase of the product, helping identify strong client groups.
